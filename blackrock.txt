Abstract: The concept of similarity is crucial in finance, aiding in pattern recognition and decision-making. This discussion highlights its relevance and the limitations of unsupervised clustering, which lacks a definitive evaluative framework, leading to potential misalignments in downstream tasks.
We introduce distance metric learning, which overcomes these limitations by learning an optimal distance function, improving the accuracy of similarity assessments. Supervised similarity, especially through tree-based models, offers a more targeted approach, utilizing proximity measures for enhanced financial modeling.
Proximity opens doors to various applications, including similarity assessment, prototype identification, critique analysis, missing value imputation, and anomaly detection. These are vital for data integrity and model refinement.
Finally, we explore using random forest in an unsupervised context for effective imputation, refined similarity, and improved anomaly detection, showcasing its adaptability in financial data analysis.
Join us to uncover the strategic use of similarity measures, from unsupervised clustering to supervised proximity, and their impact on financial analysis.
