<H1>The Blessing of Dimensionality: Theory and Applications</H1>

<h2>A Summer Workshop at the University of Connecticut</h2>
<h3>July 15-18, 2024</h3>
<div>
<p>
    We’re excited to see you at “Blessings of dimensionality: theory and applications”. 
    The objective of this workshop is to deepen our understanding of the connection between 
    concentration of measure and high dimensional statistics, to resolve open questions and 
    to generate interesting new questions. <br>  Theoretical topics include random matrix theory, 
    shrinkage dimension reduction, high dimensional geometry, optimization, spectral methods, 
    dynamical systems and the curses and blessings of dimensionality.   Applications include 
    machine learning, genomics, signal processing and portfolio theory. 
    <BR>
    To provide some background, we recommend the following reading material:
    <ul>
        <li>Chapter 2 in the book “<a href="https://home.ttic.edu/~avrim/book.pdf">Foundations of Data Science</a>,” 
            by Avrim Blum, John Hopcroft, and Ravindran Kannan (2020).</li>
