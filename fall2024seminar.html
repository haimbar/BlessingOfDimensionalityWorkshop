  <b>Description</b>: We focus on applications of high-dimensional data analysis to finance, machine learning,
 genomics, neuroscience and engineering.
The seminar will be held across four universities (UC Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, Florida State University, and UConn),
 with lectures by students, faculty, and guest speakers. Students are expected to participate in-person 
 in the weekly cross-campus meetings, which will be connected via zoom. The formal presentation will start 
 at 4:10pm ET / 1:10pm PT, and we will continue with informal discussions and exploration of possibilities for future research. 
 Students are encouraged to join collaborative projects emphasizing studies with empirical and simulated data, 
 and to write up and present their own research.
