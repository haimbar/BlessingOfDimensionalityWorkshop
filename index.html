<H1>The Blessing of Dimensionality: Theory and Applications</H1>

<h2>A Summer Workshop at the University of Connecticut</h2>
<h3>July 15-18, 2024</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, data analyses have been significantly affected by the 
development of high-dimensional statistical inference.  In an increasing number of domains, the number of features being measured per observation far exceeds the total number of observations.
For instance, in microbiology, millions of genes, proteins, or metabolites can be measured for a single 
individual. High-resolution imaging, finance, online advertising, and climate studies, 
to name a few areas, are among the fields processing observations of very high dimensional data. The classical 
theories and software tools developed for the large N (sample size) small P (number of feature)
scenarios are of little use in this Big Data context. These classical approaches suffer 
from the so-called “curse of dimensionality” – suggesting that collecting more information
on each subject in a sample worsens the ability to yield good predictions.

It turns out
that in very high-dimensional spaces, a signal can be more easily separated from noise.
This is because, in high dimensions, noise has characteristic features that allow it to be partly filtered out
in well-defined ways.  This theory
relies on convex geometry in high dimensional Euclidean spaces, 
where one can take advantage of the so-called concentration of measure property.  Concentration of measure is related to the 
well-known theory of shrinkage estimation in the statistical literature, where one gains 
power by borrowing information across multiple predictors in order to improve the estimation 
of parameters in models of interest.

<b>Workshop objective</b>:  We aim to solve outstanding theoretical and applied problems in this exciting domain of high dimensional data.
The workshop will bring experts from a variety of fields together with early-career researchers to spur new collaborations.
The program is a mix of introductory and foundational talks, open discussions, and sessions aimed at identifying problems and common underlying themes across a variety of fields.   We hope that participants
will leave with new ideas and problems, and fruitful connections with new collaborators.
