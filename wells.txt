The middle-scale asymptotics of Wishart matrices

We study the behavior of a real $p$-dimensional Wishart random matrix
with $n$ degrees of freedom when $n,p \rightarrow \infty$ but $p/n
\rightarrow 0$. We establish the existence of phase transitions when
$p$ grows at the order $n^{(K+1)/(K+3)}$ for every positive integer
$K$, and derive expressions for approximating densities between every
two phase transitions.  To do this, we make use of a novel tool we
call the G-conjugate of an absolutely continuous distribution, which
is obtained from the Fourier transform of the square root of its
density.  I will also discuss applications of the results to
high-dimensional inference, asymptotic equivalence of covariance
experiments, and random graph theory.

This is joint work with Didier Ch\'etelat.
